# CSharpPlayersGuide

For notice, this repository was created to keep track of the exercises of the book "The C# Player`s Guide" from RB Whitaker.

The code written here is my own, and was created based on the requirements presented on the book from each Chapter.

So, if you want the "Official" solution for the exercises, please refer to the https://csharpplayersguide.com/solutions.
